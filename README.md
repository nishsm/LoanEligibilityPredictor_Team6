# LoanEligibilityPredictor_Team6
Data Analytics Project


Abstract—A bank’s profit or loss depends to a large extent on loans i.e. whether the customers are paying back the loan or defaulting. This project deals with deciding if a person, or organisation, applying for a loan, is eligible for that loan, i.e., if they are likely to be able to repay the bank. This can be useful in reducing the time and  manpower required to approve loans and filter out the perfect candidates for providing loans.
